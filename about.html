      <p>I am passionate about user centric design, everywhere from the inital conceptualization of a product to the validation of the deliverables. My experience in development, product management, and SCRUM Mastering allows me to work very efficiently and effectively with other teams and departments. I have designed single products and product families, and am equally at home as a team member or a team lead.  I take pride in my work and I play very well with others. Organizations such as Amazon, Warner Brothers, and the NHL use the products that I have designed, and my interfaces have been used live at the Sundance Film Festival and at Wimbledon.</p>
      <p>The <a href='index.html'>portfolio section</a> contains a few recent highlights of my work, and the <a href='process.html'>process section</a> shows the methodology that I've had success with in the past. Feel free to <a href='contact.html'>contact me</a> to have a discussion about the needs of your organization and to explore a fit.</p>
